Fluid is can  convert distributed caching systems (such as Alluxio and JuiceFS) into observable caching services with self-management, elastic scaling, and self-healing capabilities, and it does so by supporting dataset operations. At the same time, through the data caching location information, Fluid can provide data-affinity scheduling for applications using datasets.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"demos/demo-accelerate-PVC-with-fluid":{"id":"demos/demo-accelerate-PVC-with-fluid","title":"Demo-Accelerate PVC with Fluid","description":"","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"demos/demo-accelerate-remote-file-accessing-with-fluid":{"id":"demos/demo-accelerate-remote-file-accessing-with-fluid","title":"Demo-Accelerate Remote File Accessing with Fluid","description":"","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"demos/demo-machine-learning-with-fluid":{"id":"demos/demo-machine-learning-with-fluid","title":"Demo-Machine Learning with Fluid","description":"","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"demos/demo-on-the-fly-dataset-cache-scaling":{"id":"demos/demo-on-the-fly-dataset-cache-scaling","title":"Demo-On-the-fly Dataset Cache Scaling","description":"","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"demos/demo-preload-dataset-with-fluid":{"id":"demos/demo-preload-dataset-with-fluid","title":"Demo-Preload Dataset with Fluid","description":"","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"developer-guide/client-usage/access-via-REST":{"id":"developer-guide/client-usage/access-via-REST","title":"Access via REST","description":"Alluxio provides an access interface based on the Restful API for secondary development in Python, Java and Golang.
